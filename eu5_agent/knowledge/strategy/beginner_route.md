# Ultimate Beginner Route for EU5

## Who This Is For
New EU5 players wanting a clear, safe learning arc across diplomacy, economy, and war. This route builds confidence through progressively more complex challenges.

## Recommended Learning Order

Follow this progression to gradually increase complexity:

1. **Portugal** — Safe trade start. Focus on marketplaces in key ports, one strong ally, and early trade development. Learn the basics of economy and trade without major threats.

2. **England** — Naval control. Master naval dominance and economic transformation. Learn to manage multiple fronts while maintaining trade income.

3. **Castile** — Balanced Iberian wars. Practice short, efficient wars. Learn to manage estates and prepare for colonial expansion.

4. **Ottomans** — Confident expansion. Navigate multi-front expansion and logistics management. Learn supply lines and strategic warfare.

5. **France** — High-agency hegemon. Master domestic consolidation and decisive early wars. Learn to manage large-scale operations.

## Core Habits to Build

Build these habits early—they apply to every nation and difficulty level:

- **Food/Housing First:** Staff buildings before adding more. Idle buildings produce nothing. Ensure your population has the basics before expanding.

- **One Solid Ally:** Pick fewer enemies early. Avoid multi-front commitments. One strong alliance is better than many weak ones.

- **Fight Short Wars on Good Terrain:** Choose battles wisely. Defend crossings, hills, and forts. Avoid long supply tails and winter routes.

- **Expand Trade Capacity Early:** Build marketplaces on key hubs. Expand capacity before multi-market juggling. Focus on high-value routes.

- **Avoid Idle Builds:** Don't build more structures than you have workers. Unstaffed buildings waste resources.

## Five Early Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Overbuilding into Unemployment:** Building more structures than you have workers. Idle buildings produce nothing and waste resources.

2. **Zero Trade Capacity in Target Markets:** Trying to trade through markets without capacity to handle your goods. Plan capacity before expansion.

3. **Two-Front Wars in Y1–Y10:** Getting pulled into conflicts on multiple borders. Focus on one front at a time, especially early.

4. **Siege-Chasing into Attrition:** Chasing defeated enemies into supply-poor areas. Attrition kills armies faster than battles.

5. **Granting Too Many Estate Privileges:** Losing crown power through excessive privileges. Balance estates carefully—privileges come at a cost.
