# EU5 Advances Mechanics

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the advances, institutions, ages, and research systems in Europa Universalis 5.

## Overview

EU5 replaces the traditional EU4 technology system with a more flexible **Advances system** tied to historical ages and institutions.

**Key Change from EU4**:
- No more administrative/diplomatic/military tech levels
- Instead: Advances within institution trees
- Research tied to historical ages (100-year periods)
- Focus selection determines available advances
- More flexible, less linear progression

## Ages System

Ages represent distinct periods of history, each with unique mechanics, institutions, and advance trees.

### Age Duration

**Standard Length**: Most ages last **100 years**

**Exception**: Age of Traditions ends after only **5 years** (on January 1st, 1342)

### Ages in EU5

1. **Age of Traditions** (1337-1342)
2. **Age of Renaissance** (1342-1442)
3. **Age of Discovery** (1442-1542)
4. **Age of Reformation** (1542-1642)
5. **Age of Absolutism** (1642-1742)
6. **Age of Revolutions** (1742-1842)

### Age Mechanics

**Each age features**:
- Three unique institutions
- Distinct advance trees
- Age-specific rules and mechanics
- Historical events and situations
- Building cost scaling (affects construction)

**Age Transitions**:
- Automatic at end of 100-year period
- All countries transition simultaneously
- New institutions spawn
- New advances become available
- Focus can be changed

## Institutions

**Institutions represent major cultural or technological paradigm shifts** that fundamentally change how societies operate.

### Institution Fundamentals

**Definition**: Transformative historical developments like the Renaissance or Printing Press.

**Critical Importance**: Institutions are **the single most important factor** determining national progress. Falling behind on institutions can doom a nation to irrelevance.

**Three Institutions Per Age**:
- Each age introduces three new institutions
- Each institution has an associated advance tree
- Institutions must spread and be embraced
- Unlock new technologies and capabilities

### Institution Spreading

**Spawn Mechanics**:
- Institutions spawn in specific locations based on criteria
- **Example**: Renaissance institutions spawn in Italy (same culture as primary culture)
- Cultural and geographical factors determine spawn location
- Spreads from spawn location to nearby provinces

**Spread Mechanics**:
- Institutions spread gradually across the map
- Faster spread to nearby locations
- Cultural similarity speeds spread
- Development level affects spread speed
- Trade connections facilitate spread
- Buildings can accelerate spread

**Spread Percentage**:
- Tracked as percentage in each province
- 0% = institution completely absent
- 100% = institution fully present
- Affects research costs for associated advances

### Embracing Institutions

**Embrace Threshold**: Once an institution has spread **at least 20%** in a country, it can be embraced.

**Embrace Cost**:
- Scaled based on country size and development
- Larger, more developed nations pay more
- Earlier embrace costs less than later embrace
- Critical investment for staying competitive

**Embrace Effects**:
1. **Unlocks new branch in advances tree**
2. **Begins spreading institution from capital**
3. **Reduces research costs** for associated advances
4. **Enables new buildings and units**
5. **Prevents falling behind technologically**

**Strategic Timing**:
- Embrace too early = waste resources
- Embrace too late = fall behind competitors
- Ideal: Embrace at 20-30% spread
- Prioritize institutions relevant to your strategy

### Example: Age of Renaissance Institutions

**Three Renaissance Institutions** spawn in the Age of Renaissance:
- Spawn in Italy (locations with Italian culture)
- Represent cultural and technological innovations
- Each unlocks distinct advance tree
- Must be embraced to access advanced technologies

## Advances System

Advances represent **ideas, inventions, technologies, and other examples of progress** unlocked over time.

### Research Mechanics

**One Advance at a Time**:
- Each country can research only one advance at a time
- Must complete current advance before starting next
- Choose carefully based on strategic needs

**Research Progress Requirements**:
- **Current Age Advances**: Require **25 Research Progress**
- **Previous Age Advances**: Require **17 Research Progress**
- Older advances cheaper (easier to catch up)

**Research Storage**:
- If not researching an advance, store up to **12 months** of research progress
- Starting new research uses stored progress
- Prevents waste when between advances
- Strategic: Store progress while deciding next advance

### Focus Selection

**At the start of each age, countries select one of three focuses**:

1. **Administrative Ability** (Paper icon)
2. **Diplomatic Ability** (Dove icon)
3. **Military Ability** (Crossed swords icon)

**Focus Effects**:
- Determines options in advance tree for that age
- Cannot access other focus trees in same age
- Commits you to strategic path
- Choose based on national strategy

**Focus Strategy**:
- **Administrative**: Internal development, economy, governance
- **Diplomatic**: Relations, trade, colonization
- **Military**: Army, navy, warfare capabilities
- **Balance**: Vary focus across ages for well-rounded nation

### Advance Trees

**Structure**:
- Each institution has an associated advance tree
- Tree branches based on selected focus
- Sequential unlocks (prerequisites required)
- Some advances unlock others

**Advance Types**:
- **Technologies**: Ship designs, production methods, military units
- **Ideas**: Bonuses to specific areas
- **Inventions**: Unlock new mechanics or buildings
- **Capabilities**: Enable new actions (e.g., "Drill Army", "March to the Sound of Guns")

**Examples of Advances**:
- **Diplomatic**: Increased diplomat limit
- **Military**: "March to the Sound of Guns" army action
- **Administrative**: Improved production methods
- **Naval**: New ship designs

### Research Progression Strategy

**Early Age**:
- Focus on foundational advances
- Ensure institutions embraced at 20%
- Build research infrastructure
- Don't fall behind on critical institutions

**Mid Age**:
- Complete current age advances
- Selectively research previous age advances
- Balance breadth vs. depth
- Leverage 17-progress cost for catch-up

**Late Age**:
- Maximize current age advances
- Fill gaps from previous ages
- Prepare for next age transition
- Store research progress before age change

## Integration with Other Systems

### Government Power

**Administrative Focus**:
- Many advances improve administrative efficiency
- Government power generation affected
- Cabinet effectiveness enhanced
- Reforms enabled

### Military Units

**Military Advances Required**:
- New unit types locked behind advances
- Ship designs need specific advances
- Army capabilities require research
- "Drill Army" requires advance with same name

### Diplomatic Capacity

**Diplomatic Advances**:
- Maximum diplomats increased by certain advances
- Diplomatic actions unlocked
- Relations capacity improved
- Colonial range extended

### Economy

**Production Methods**:
- Advanced production methods require specific advances
- Buildings unlocked through research
- Economic efficiency improvements
- Trade capabilities enhanced

### Society

**Societal Values**:
- Some advances shift societal values
- Employment systems unlocked
- Population mechanics enhanced
- Estate interactions modified

## Strategic Considerations

### Institution Priority

**Critical Institutions to Embrace Early**:
1. **Renaissance** (if European): Unlocks cultural advances
2. **Printing Press**: Spreads ideas and reduces unrest
3. **Colonialism** (if naval power): Enables colonial expansion
4. **Military innovations**: Stay competitive in warfare

**Less Urgent Institutions**:
- Those not aligned with your strategy
- Institutions that haven't spread to neighbors
- Late-age institutions with low impact

### Focus Selection Strategy

**Administrative Focus When**:
- Building tall (development over expansion)
- Economic powerhouse strategy
- Internal stability issues
- Need government reforms

**Diplomatic Focus When**:
- Colonial strategy
- Trade empire building
- Alliance network important
- Vassalization strategy

**Military Focus When**:
- Aggressive expansion planned
- Surrounded by hostile neighbors
- Naval power critical
- Military quality over quantity

### Research Timing

**When to Store Research**:
- Between strategic objectives
- Uncertain which advance needed next
- Approaching age transition
- Waiting for institution to spawn

**When to Rush Research**:
- Critical military advance needed for war
- Falling behind neighbors
- Institution unlock essential
- Unique opportunity (e.g., colonization window)

### Catch-Up Mechanics

**Falling Behind**:
- Previous age advances cost 17 (vs. 25 for current)
- Easier to catch up on older technology
- Institutions spread from neighbors naturally
- Can leapfrog by focusing on current age

**Staying Ahead**:
- Embrace institutions at 20% threshold
- Complete current age advances first
- Build institutions spread infrastructure
- Help institutions spread to provinces

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Ignoring Institutions**: Falling behind dooms your nation to irrelevance
2. **Wrong Focus Selection**: Committing to wrong strategic path for entire age
3. **Late Institution Embrace**: Waiting too long to embrace at 20% threshold
4. **Wasting Research Progress**: Not utilizing 12-month storage mechanic
5. **Unbalanced Research**: Only focusing on one ability type across all ages
6. **Neglecting Previous Ages**: Missing cheap (17-progress) advances from older ages
7. **Poor Institution Spreading**: Not building infrastructure to accelerate spread
8. **Age Transition Surprise**: Not preparing for automatic age change

## Advanced Strategies

### Institution Spreading

**Accelerate Spread to Your Territory**:
- Build universities and libraries
- Develop high-development provinces
- Establish trade connections with source regions
- Conquer provinces with high institution presence
- Cultural policies to reduce resistance

**Prevent Spreading to Rivals**:
- Cannot directly prevent (institutions spread naturally)
- Relative advantage: Embrace early, they fall behind
- Economic warfare: Disrupt their trade
- Military pressure: Keep them in wars (war exhaustion slows progress)

### Multi-Age Planning

**Long-Term Strategy**:
- Plan focus selection across multiple ages
- Age 1: Administrative (economy)
- Age 2: Military (expansion)
- Age 3: Diplomatic (consolidation)
- Adapt based on circumstances

**Flexibility**:
- Age transitions offer reset opportunities
- Change strategy when situation changes
- Balance overall advancement

### Research Prioritization

**Essential Advances First**:
- Military advances before major wars
- Economic advances during peacetime
- Diplomatic advances before colonization
- Situational: Respond to threats and opportunities

**Nice-to-Have Advances Later**:
- Marginal improvements
- Niche capabilities
- Advances for playstyle variety
