## Societal Values System

Countries progress along **17 societal value axes**, each with two opposing
poles on a 0-100 scale. These values shape government capabilities and national
character.

### Key Societal Value Axes

#### Centralization vs. Decentralization (0-100)

- **Centralization Effects**:
  - Increases crown power
  - Reduces proximity costs
  - Improves counterespionage
- **Decentralization Effects**:
  - Increases local autonomy
  - Reduces central control

#### Traditionalist vs. Innovative (0-100)

- **Traditionalist Effects**:
  - Strengthens cultural tradition
  - Slower adoption of new institutions
- **Innovative Effects**:
  - Increases literacy
  - Faster institution adoption rates
  - Greater technological advancement

#### Spiritualist vs. Humanist (0-100)

- **Spiritualist Effects**:
  - Controls religious tolerance
  - Affects conversion speeds
  - Religious focus in governance
- **Humanist Effects**:
  - Greater religious tolerance
  - Reduced conversion emphasis

#### Aristocracy vs. Plutocracy (0-100)

- **Aristocracy Effects**:
  - Nobility holds more influence
  - Traditional power structures
- **Plutocracy Effects**:
  - Burghers (merchant class) wield more power

### Special Regional Axes

**Islamic Nations**:

- **Mysticism-Jurisprudence Axis**: Balances religious interpretation approaches

**Non-Chinese Rulers in Asia**:

- **Sinicized-Unsinicized Axis**: Measures cultural adoption of Chinese customs

## Cabinet System

The Cabinet system allows delegation of government tasks to trusted officials.

### Basic Cabinet Mechanics

- **Starting Positions**: 2 cabinet positions
- **Expansion**: Additional positions unlocked through advances
- **Cabinet Actions**: Members perform designated actions until reassigned
- **Initial Cost**: Gold only
- **Replacement Cost**: **5 Stability** to replace existing cabinet members

### Head of Cabinet

**Availability**: Not available for tribes

**Appointment Cost**:

- Substantial gold
- **5 Government Power**

**Effects**:

- Increases cabinet efficiency by **+25%**
- Prevents that member from commanding armies
- Cannot be removed once appointed

### Cabinet Strategy

- Assign members to automated tasks
- Use cabinet to manage routine governance
- Balance efficiency gains vs. military leadership needs
- Expand cabinet size through technological/institutional advances

## Regency Mechanics

Regencies activate when rulers die without adult heirs. The system follows a
strict hierarchy determining regent type.

### Regency Type Hierarchy

The game checks for regents in this order:

1. **Fraternal Struggle**: Dynasty members compete for regency
2. **Judicial Conclave**: Clergy assumes control
3. **Mamlūk Succession**: Nobility with Mamluk trait
4. **Papal Conclave**: Clergy (for Catholic nations)
5. **Election Administration**: Burghers assume temporary control
6. **Estate Regencies**: Various estates step in
7. **Overlord/Subject Regencies**: Based on vassal relations
8. **Consort Regency**: Spouse assumes regency (if available)
9. **Interregnum**: Random character selected

### Regency Effects

Each regency type produces distinct effects:

- **Stability changes**: Some regencies cause instability
- **Estate satisfaction shifts**: Affects which estates benefit or lose power
- **Societal values development**: Different regencies push values in different

  directions

- **Duration**: Varies by type until heir comes of age

### Managing Regencies

- Plan succession carefully to avoid weak regencies
- Consider estate balance when entering potential regency situations
- Some regency types are more stable than others
- Prepare for stability costs during transitions

## Government Power

Each government type generates and uses government power differently:

### Power Generation

- **Monarchy (Legitimacy)**: Generated through dynasty strength, royal

  marriages, and stable succession

- **Republic (Republican Tradition)**: Generated through elections and civic

  institutions

- **Theocracy (Devotion)**: Generated through religious authority and piety
- **Tribe (Tribal Cohesion)**: Generated through kinship ties and traditional

  authority

- **Steppe Horde (Horde Unity)**: Generated through military success and

  conquest

### Power Uses

Government power is spent on:

- Appointing cabinet members (5 Government Power for Head of Cabinet)
- Enacting reforms
- Granting estate privileges (5 Government Power per privilege)
- Changing government type (25 Government Power)
- Various diplomatic and internal actions

## Strategic Considerations

### Choosing Government Type

- **Monarchy**: Best for diplomacy and dynasty-building
- **Republic**: Best for stability and avoiding succession crises
- **Theocracy**: Best for religious nations seeking divine authority
- **Tribe**: Transitional government, reform when ready
- **Steppe Horde**: High-risk, high-reward military expansion

### Societal Values Strategy

- Guide values toward your strategic goals
- Balance centralization with local control needs
- Innovation vs. Tradition affects technology adoption
- Estate influence controlled by Aristocracy-Plutocracy axis

### Cabinet Management

- Prioritize expansion of cabinet positions
- Assign routine tasks to free your attention
- Head of Cabinet provides major efficiency boost
- Consider stability cost when replacing members
