# EU5 Military Mechanics

This document provides a comprehensive overview of military systems in Europa
Universalis 5.

## Unit Types

EU5 features two main military unit categories with distinct characteristics:

### Professional Troops

**Characteristics**:

- Elite standing army
- Expensive but highly effective
- Maintain consistent strength without morale penalties
- Excel in prolonged campaigns

**Scaling**:

- Start with **100 men** per unit (10% damage potential)
- Scale to **3,000 soldiers** per regiment at full development
- At full scale, deal **triple the damage of levies**
- Higher base stats than levies

**Strategic Use**:

- Core of your military
- Long-term campaigns
- Professional sieges
- Elite battles

### Levies

**Characteristics**:

- Raised from remaining manpower during war or rebellions
- **1,000 men base size** per unit
- Less expensive than professionals
- Reduce population when raised

**Strategic Use**:

- **Recommended for early game** (before professionals scale)
- Emergency reinforcements
- Defensive wars
- Supplementing professional armies

## Army Composition

Armies consist of four unit types organized into fronts and reserves:

### Unit Roles

#### Infantry

- **Role**: Battle line foundation
- **Function**: Absorbs enemy charges, holds the line
- **Priority**: Essential for all armies
- **Best Use**: Center front

#### Archers

- **Role**: Ranged support
- **Function**: Deal damage from behind lines
- **Priority**: Support for infantry
- **Best Use**: Reserve or rear positions

#### Cavalry

- **Role**: Flanking and pursuit
- **Function**: Flank maneuvers, chase broken enemies
- **Priority**: Mobility and shock damage
- **Best Use**: Left and right flanks

#### Artillery

- **Role**: Siege and bombardment
- **Function**: Essential for sieges, long-range damage
- **Priority**: Critical for taking fortifications
- **Best Use**: Reserve, siege operations

### Recommended Compositions

**Balanced Field Army**:

- Professional infantry core (60%)
- Cavalry flanks (20%)
- Artillery reserves (15%)
- Limited mercenaries for reinforcement (5%)

**Siege Army**:

- Artillery (high priority)
- Professional infantry
- Reduced cavalry (less important for sieges)

**Early Game Army** (before professional scaling):

- Levy-based infantry
- Some cavalry for flanking
- Minimal artillery
- Focus on numbers over quality

## Battle Mechanics

### Battle Formation

**The game automatically arranges troops into three sections**:

1. **Center**: Main battle line
2. **Left Flank**: Side engagement
3. **Right Flank**: Side engagement

**Frontage Determinants**:

- Terrain type
- Vegetation density
- General's administrative ability

**Reserve System**:

- Units in reserve support front lines
- Can reinforce depleted fronts
- Artillery typically placed in reserve

### Combat Power

#### Combat Power Formula

Unit's damage attribute × regiment's manpower

**Factors Affecting Combat Power**:

- Unit type and quality
- Morale level
- Terrain modifiers
- General's abilities
- Technology level
- Unit discipline

### Battle Phases

1. **Deployment**: Armies arrange into formation
2. **Engagement**: Front lines clash
3. **Reserve Commitment**: Reserves reinforce lines
4. **Pursuit**: Winning army chases routing enemy
5. **Resolution**: Victor consolidates, loser retreats

### Terrain Impact

Different terrains affect battle:

- **Plains**: Favorable for cavalry
- **Hills**: Defensive advantage
- **Mountains**: Severe penalties for attackers
- **Rivers**: Crossing penalty
- **Forests**: Reduced frontage

**Strategic Principle**: Defend on good terrain, attack on favorable ground.

## Manpower System

### Manpower Sources

**To increase manpower**:

1. **Population Growth**:
   - Larger population = more manpower
   - Ensure food and housing
   - Promote population prosperity

2. **Control**:
   - Higher control in provinces
   - Increases manpower contribution
   - Improves recruitment efficiency

3. **Military Buildings**:
   - **Armories**: Directly expand manpower pool
   - **Sergeantries**: Increase recruitment capacity
   - **Barracks**: Improve military readiness

4. **Estate Contributions**:
   - Nobility provides military levies
   - Keep nobility satisfied for manpower bonuses

### Manpower Management

**Reinfor

cement Mechanics**:

- Regular regiments below maximum strength will attempt to reinforce
- Must be located **within friendly borders**
- Draws **Manpower** and **Gold** to refill

**Conservation Strategies**:

- Avoid unnecessary battles
- Use terrain to minimize losses
- Retreat before complete destruction
- Supplement with mercenaries when manpower low

## Generals and Admirals

### Leader Abilities

Military leaders provide bonuses:

**Administrative Ability**:

- Increases army frontage
- Improves siege efficiency
- Better army organization

**Military Skill**:

- Direct combat bonuses
- Improved tactics
- Better morale

**Diplomatic Skill** (for admirals):

- Naval efficiency
- Better fleet coordination

### Leader Management

- Assign best generals to main armies
- Rotate leaders to gain experience
- Replace poor leaders when possible
- Balance leader abilities with army needs

## Morale System

### Morale Mechanics

**Morale represents army fighting spirit**:

- Full morale = maximum effectiveness
- Low morale = reduced combat power
- Zero morale = army routs

**Morale Recovery**:

- Armies recover morale when not in combat
- Faster recovery in friendly territory
- Slower recovery while moving
- Instant recovery when disbanded

**Morale Damage**:

- Taken during battles
- Increased by enemy quality
- Modified by terrain
- Affected by leader skill

## Discipline

**Discipline represents training and cohesion**:

- Higher discipline = more damage dealt
- Reduces damage taken
- Improves army effectiveness

**Increasing Discipline**:

- Military technology
- Government reforms
- Idea groups
- Advisor bonuses
- National traditions

## Naval Mechanics

### Fleet Composition

Similar to armies, fleets consist of:

- **Heavy Ships**: Battle line, high combat power
- **Light Ships**: Trade protection, scouting
- **Galleys**: Coastal warfare (Mediterranean)
- **Transports**: Troop movement

### Naval Combat

- Similar mechanics to land combat
- Influenced by admiral skill
- Affected by naval technology
- Weather impacts battles

### Naval Operations

**Blockades**:

- Block enemy ports
- Reduce trade and food
- Support sieges
- Generate warscore

**Trade Protection**:

- Light ships protect trade routes
- Generate trade income
- Counter piracy

**Transport Operations**:

- Move armies across water
- Require transport ships
- Vulnerable to enemy fleets

## Siege Warfare

### Siege Mechanics

**Siege Progress**:

- Determined by artillery quantity
- Modified by fort level
- Affected by garrison size
- Influenced by general's administrative ability

**Siege Phases**:

1. **Investment**: Surrounding the fort
2. **Bombardment**: Artillery damage
3. **Assault Options**: Speed up siege (costly)
4. **Breach**: Fort falls

### Siege Strategy

**Optimal Siege Army**:

- Maximum artillery
- Sufficient infantry to prevent sorties
- Minimal cavalry (not needed)
- Skilled general with high administrative ability

**Siege Tips**:

- More artillery = faster sieges
- Protect siege from relief armies
- Consider assault only when necessary (high casualties)
- Blockade coastal forts with navy

## Military Technology

### Technology Progression

Military technology improves:

- Unit combat stats
- Army morale
- Discipline bonuses
- New unit types
- Tactical options

### Technology Strategy

- Keep military tech competitive
- Prioritize when facing stronger enemies
- Balance with administrative and diplomatic tech
- Use institutions to reduce costs

## Strategic Principles

### Army Management

1. **Quality vs. Quantity**:
   - Early game: Quantity (levies)
   - Mid game: Balance
   - Late game: Quality (professionals)

2. **Composition Balance**:
   - Field armies: Balanced mix
   - Siege armies: Artillery-heavy
   - Defensive armies: Infantry-focused

3. **Manpower Conservation**:
   - Avoid wasteful battles
   - Use terrain advantages
   - Retreat strategically
   - Supplement with mercenaries

### Combat Tactics

1. **Terrain Selection**:
   - Defend on hills/mountains
   - Cross rivers against enemy
   - Avoid attacking in bad terrain

2. **Force Concentration**:
   - Combine armies for major battles
   - Split for sieges
   - Avoid getting separated by enemy

3. **Strategic Depth**:
   - Maintain reserves
   - Have reinforcement armies ready
   - Don't commit entire military at once

### Common Mistakes

1. **Overextending armies**: Running out of manpower
2. **Poor composition**: Too much cavalry or not enough artillery
3. **Ignoring terrain**: Attacking across rivers or mountains
4. **Neglecting generals**: Using armies without leaders
5. **Wasteful assaults**: Assaulting forts unnecessarily

## Integration with Other Systems

### Economic Support

Military requires:

- Gold for recruitment and maintenance
- Manpower from population
- Trade for naval supplies
- Production for equipment

### Political Support

- Nobility provides military bonuses
- Government type affects army quality
