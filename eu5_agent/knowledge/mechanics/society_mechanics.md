# EU5 Society Mechanics

This document provides a comprehensive overview of estates, population classes, and social systems in Europa Universalis 5.

## Estate System Overview

Estates function as **special interest groups within a country** that provide taxation, army levies, and naval support. Each character in your nation belongs to one estate, creating a complex social structure that affects governance.

**Estate names vary** based on:
- Government type
- Culture
- Religion

## Estate Types

EU5 features seven distinct estate categories:

1. **Nobility**: Landowning aristocracy, military leaders, traditional power
2. **Clergy**: Religious authorities, church officials, spiritual leaders
3. **Burghers**: Merchant class, urban traders, economic power
4. **Commoners**: Peasantry, working class, agricultural laborers
5. **Tribes**: Tribal societies (specific regions/government types)
6. **Dhimmi**: Religious minorities (Islamic countries)
7. **Cossacks**: Military frontiersmen (specific regions)
8. **Crown**: The government itself (special estate)

## Three Core Estate Statistics

### 1. Estate Power

**Definition**: "Political strength within government and how much influence the estate has when debating parliament."

**Effects by Power Level**:

**Below 25% Power**:
- Grants scaling tax bonuses
- Estate has minimal political influence
- Crown maintains strong control

**Above 25% Power**:
- Provides different bonuses
- Reduces maximum tax revenue
- Estate gains political leverage
- Can oppose government policies

**Strategic Balance**: Manage estate power to maximize benefits while maintaining control.

### 2. Estate Satisfaction

**Definition**: Measures estate contentment with how the country is being ruled.

**Satisfaction Levels**:

**Above 50% Satisfaction**:
- Country gains bonuses
- Estate provides full support
- Levies and taxes maximized
- Positive effects on stability

**Below 50% Satisfaction**:
- Country receives penalties
- Reduced cooperation
- Lower levy availability
- Risk of internal conflict

**Below 25% Satisfaction** (Critical):
- **Levies become unavailable**
- Severe penalties applied
- Risk of rebellion
- Immediate action required

**Satisfaction Equilibrium**: The value estates naturally drift toward over time. Estates gradually move toward their equilibrium satisfaction level unless actively managed.

### 3. Estate Opinion

**Definition**: Each estate's stance toward other countries.

**Effects**:
- Influences diplomatic preferences
- Affects hostility decisions
- Can pressure government toward certain foreign policies
- Estates may oppose wars or alliances based on their opinion

## Estate Privileges

Non-Crown estates may receive privileges to increase their satisfaction and power.

### Privilege Mechanics

**Granting Privileges**:
- **Cost**: 5 Government Power per privilege
- **Satisfaction Increase**: Equal to **3× the Satisfaction Equilibrium** provided by privilege
- **Power Increase**: Grants additional estate power
- **Bonuses**: Various benefits depending on privilege type

**Revoking Privileges**:
- **Cost**: 4 Stability per 1% estate power
- Extremely expensive for powerful estates
- Only revoke when necessary
- Plan privilege grants carefully as they're hard to remove

### Privilege Strategy

**When to Grant**:
- Estate satisfaction is critically low
- Need specific bonuses from privilege
- Building long-term relationship with estate
- Have government power to spare

**What to Avoid**:
- Over-granting privileges (hard to revoke)
- Giving privileges to already powerful estates
- Granting without considering long-term consequences
- Trading stability for short-term satisfaction

## The Crown Estate

The Crown represents **government power without population**.

### Crown Mechanics

**Crown Power Scaling**:
- Scales with country population
- Increases with ruler's administrative ability
- Represents centralized government authority

**Crown Benefits**:
- Provides reforms instead of privileges
- Strengthens central administration
- Increases cabinet efficiency when powerful

**Crown Power Effects**:

**Below 25% Crown Power**:
- Government penalties
- Weak central authority
- Estates dominate politics

**Above 25% Crown Power**:
- Government bonuses
- **Cabinet efficiency increases**
- Strong centralized control
- Better reform enactment

### Balancing Crown vs. Estates

**Strong Crown** (Centralized):
- Better government efficiency
- Faster reforms
- More control over policy
- Lower estate satisfaction

**Strong Estates** (Decentralized):
- Higher estate satisfaction
- Better levy support
- Estate-specific bonuses
- Less government control

## Population Classes (Pops)

Pops are individual population units with distinct characteristics:

### Pop Attributes

Each pop has:
- **Culture**: Determines cultural identity and acceptance
- **Religion**: Affects tolerance and conversion
- **Social Class**: Determines which estate they belong to
- **Location**: Province/region where they reside
- **Employment**: What building/industry they work in

### Pop Behavior

**Population Growth**:
- Depends on food security
- Affected by housing availability
- Influenced by prosperity
- Modified by stability and health

**Migration**:
- Pops move from low-attraction to high-attraction areas
- Prefer nearby locations
- Follow legal restrictions
- Influenced by employment opportunities
- Stay within your market region

**Conversion & Assimilation**:
- Pops gradually convert to state religion
- Pops assimilate to dominant culture
- Speed affected by policies and tolerance
- Can be accelerated through government actions

## Estate Management Strategies

### Early Game

1. Keep all estates moderately satisfied (50-70%)
2. Don't grant too many privileges early
3. Build Crown power through admin-skilled rulers
4. Balance estate demands with government needs

### Mid Game

1. Grant strategic privileges for specific benefits
2. Use satisfaction to manage estate cooperation
3. Revoke privileges if you've built enough stability
4. Focus on Crown reforms for centralization

### Late Game

1. Optimize estate privileges for maximum efficiency
2. Maintain high satisfaction for full support
3. Use Crown power for advanced reforms
4. Balance power between Crown and estates for best bonuses

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-granting privileges**: Very expensive to revoke later
2. **Ignoring satisfaction**: Can lead to unavailable levies
3. **Neglecting Crown power**: Weak government authority
4. **Letting one estate dominate**: Unbalanced political power
5. **Revoking privileges carelessly**: Massive stability costs

## Estate-Specific Strategies

### Nobility

## Integration with Other Systems

### Government Type Effects

- **Republics**: Burghers more influential
- **Theocracies**: Clergy dominant
- **Tribes**: Tribal estates special rules

### Societal Values Interaction

- **Aristocracy-Plutocracy axis**: Determines noble vs. burgher power
- **Centralization-Decentralization**: Affects Crown vs. estate power
- **Other axes**: Modify estate satisfaction equilibrium

### Economic Integration

- Estate satisfaction affects:
  - Tax revenue
