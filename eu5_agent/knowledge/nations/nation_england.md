# England Nation Guide - EU5

## Summary at a Glance

**Goal:** Establish naval dominance and economic transformation through
trade-focused
island consolidation.

**Do this first:**

- Decide France plan early (contest or peace)
- Secure Scotland deterrent
- Build ports and marketplaces

**Pitfall to avoid:** Draining resources in prolonged continental wars while
neglecting
island security.

## Opening Context

England starts locked in the Hundred Years' War. You must choose to contest
France or
pivot to island consolidation and trade. Your position offers strong naval
potential
and access to rich trade nodes, but requires careful diplomatic management to
avoid
two-front entanglements.

## First 50 Years Checklist

Follow this checklist to establish a strong foundation:

- **Year 5:** Decide France plan—either secure Calais corridor or relinquish for
- peace
  and rebuild. Don't drag the war indefinitely.
- **Early Alliances:** Ally one continental counterweight (Burgundy or Aragon)
- and
  secure Scotland deterrent. Avoid overcommitting.
- **Infrastructure:** Invest in ports and marketplaces. Steer North Sea trade.
- Keep a
  lean army and strong navy.
- **Scotland:** Subdue or contain Scotland before continental re-entry. Secure
- the
  British Isles as your base.
- **London Market:** Develop London market capacity. Fund fleet first—naval
- dominance
  is your strength.
- **Trade Routes:** Focus on North Sea and English Channel trade nodes. Build
  marketplaces where capacity constrains.
- **Diplomatic Balance:** Maintain relations with potential continental partners
- while
  avoiding entanglement in their wars.
- **Economic Foundation:** Ensure food and housing in core provinces. Fill jobs
- in
  profitable buildings before expanding.

## Diplomacy Targets & Risks

### Key Targets

- **Burgundy or Aragon:** Potential continental counterweights to France. Choose
- based
  on your France strategy.
- **Scotland:** Subdue early or maintain deterrent alliance. Avoid leaving a
- hostile
  neighbor at your back.
- **Trade Partners:** Maintain good relations with nations in your trade
- network—
  Netherlands, northern German states.

### Risks

- **Two-Front Entanglements:** Getting pulled into wars on both continental and
- island
  fronts. Focus on one front at a time.
- **Overcommitting in France:** Draining resources in a prolonged war with
- France.
  Decide early: fight or make peace.
- **Alliance Chains:** Being dragged into continental wars through alliances. Be
  selective about which wars you honor.

## Trade Nodes Plan

England's economic strength comes from trade:

- **North Sea:** Primary trade node. Develop London market capacity to maximize
- income.
- **English Channel:** Secondary focus if you control continental holdings. High
- value
  trade flows here.
- **Marketplaces:** Build in London and key ports. Expand capacity where it
- bottlenecks
  trade income.
- **Trade Routes:** Prioritize high-margin goods. Keep routes short and secure
- from war
  disruption.

## Military Posture & Logistics

England's military strategy emphasizes naval dominance:

- **Navy First:** Build and maintain a strong fleet. Naval superiority protects
- your
  island and enables trade.
- **Lean Army:** Keep army size manageable. Focus on quality and strategic
- positioning
  rather than numbers.
- **Supply Lines:** If operating on continent, secure ports for supply. Don't
- overextend
  without supply.
- **Defensive Advantage:** Use island position defensively. Naval invasions are
  expensive for attackers.

## Alternate Routes

Alternative strategies for England:

1. **Trade Focus:** Abandon continental holdings early, focus entirely on island
   consolidation and trade empire.
2. **Colonial Expansion:** After securing British Isles, pivot to early exploration
   and colonial routes.
3. **Balanced Approach:** Maintain strategic continental holdings while building
   trade and naval power.

## Mission Strategy

Follow **Trade Focus** missions to align with England's natural trade strengths.
This path builds early trade income and naval advantages.
