# Common Beginner Mistakes in EU5

## Why This Matters

These five mistakes waste resources, stall progress, and lead to frustrating defeats. Learn to avoid them early, and you'll save hours of gameplay and build a stronger foundation for your campaigns.

**Critical:** These mistakes compound quickly. One mistake leads to another, creating cascading failures that are hard to recover from.

## Mistake 1: Building Without Staffing

**The problem:** You build manufactories and production buildings, but they remain unstaffed. You're paying maintenance for buildings that produce nothing.

### The Fix

The correct sequence is: **Food → Housing → Jobs**. Populations need food and housing before they can work. Check food and housing satisfaction before building production buildings.

Staff existing buildings fully before expanding. Only build new structures when current buildings are at or near full staffing. Check employment levels regularly.

Import missing inputs if needed. If a building requires inputs you don't have locally, import via your main market with sufficient capacity. Build marketplaces to enable imports.

Ensure market capacity is sufficient. Before creating routes or importing, verify your target market has capacity. Build marketplaces to raise capacity.

**Rule:** Never stack new buildings before staffing existing ones. Fill jobs first, then expand.

## Mistake 2: Trading With Zero Capacity

**The problem:** You try to create trade routes, but your market has zero capacity. The game blocks trade actions, and you can't generate income from trade.

### The Fix

Build marketplaces in your target market. Marketplaces are the primary way to increase trade capacity. Each marketplace adds capacity to its market. Build them in your primary trade hub first.

Start with short, high-margin routes. Focus on short routes with high profit margins first. Long routes consume more capacity and are harder to protect.

Pause low-profit routes consuming capacity. If you have multiple routes, pause the least profitable ones to free capacity for better routes.

Don't expand across markets too early. Each market requires its own infrastructure and capacity. Focus on one market first, then expand to others when ready.

**Priority:** Build your first marketplace in your capital or primary trade hub. This is usually the most efficient location.

## Mistake 3: Two-Front Wars and Attrition Races

**The problem:** You fight on multiple fronts simultaneously, or you chase enemies into winter terrain. Your armies take massive attrition losses, and you lose despite superior numbers.

### The Fix

Start with single-front wars. Focus on one theater at a time. Don't fight on multiple fronts simultaneously. Multiple fronts exhaust resources and spread forces thin.

Prioritize forts and crossings first. Control key terrain and strategic positions before engaging enemy armies. Forts and crossings give you control over movement.

Use naval blockades to force quick peaces. Naval blockades cut off supply and force quicker surrenders. Use your fleet to support land operations.

Be cautious in winter and mountain terrain. Winter terrain penalties are severe. Avoid long winter marches. Mountain terrain causes severe attrition and slow movement. Only advance when you have short, supplied paths.

**Remember:** Wars are won by taking objectives (forts, crossings, strategic provinces), not by killing armies or fighting attrition races.

## Mistake 4: Over-Granting Estate Privileges

**The problem:** You grant too many estate privileges, locking yourself out of future reforms. Low crown power makes it harder to pass reforms and maintain internal stability.

### The Fix

Pick 1–2 privileges aligned to your start. Choose privileges that match your immediate needs (tax from clergy, trade from burghers, manpower from nobles). Don't grant more than you need.

Maintain crown power for future reforms. Estates grant powerful privileges but erode crown power. Low crown power makes it harder to pass reforms and maintain control.

Reassess after major events. Privileges are not permanent. Reassess your estate balance after conquests and economic shifts. Revoke or adjust privileges when dependence wanes.

Don't trade away crown power to solve structural problems. Structural problems (low income, low capacity, poor access) should be solved through infrastructure and economic development, not estate privileges.

**Rule:** Privileges are supplements, not substitutes for proper infrastructure and economic management.

## Mistake 5: UI Overload and Forgetting Pre-War Checks

**The problem:** You declare war without proper preparation. Your armies are at low maintenance, objectives are unclear, and supply lines are unplanned. The war starts poorly and never recovers.

### The Fix

Raise maintenance before war. Keep army/navy maintenance low during peace to save cash. Increase it only when war is imminent or you're actively fighting.

Define clear campaign objectives. Know what you want to achieve (forts, crossings, strategic provinces) before declaring war. Focus on objectives, not army kills.

Plan supply routes and retreat paths. Identify supply-safe routes to your objectives. Plan your advance paths and retreat routes before war starts.

Check pre-war UI elements. Review army/navy maintenance, fort positions, enemy and ally positions, and blockade points. Avoid starting wars at low maintenance—this leads to immediate defeats.

**Critical:** Never start a war without: Cash reserves, positioned armies, supply routes, clear objectives, and raised maintenance.

## Quick Reference Checklist

Avoid these mistakes by following this checklist:

- Staff existing buildings before building new ones
- Build marketplaces before creating trade routes
- Fight on one front at a time
- Prioritize forts and crossings over army kills
- Limit estate privileges to 1–2 aligned to your start
- Raise maintenance before declaring war
- Plan supply routes and objectives before war
