# EU5 Geopolitics Mechanics

This document provides a comprehensive overview of geopolitical systems in Europa Universalis 5, including markets, claims, cores, colonization, and great power dynamics.

## Market System

EU5 replaces the static trade node system from EU4 with **dynamic, interconnected local and regional markets**.

### Market Fundamentals

**Definition**: A Market is an economic zone where goods are bought and sold, named after a Market Center but extending into multiple locations.

**Market Centers**:
- Central hub for market economic activity
- Connects multiple locations through trade
- Named location determines market identity
- Can be upgraded through development and buildings

**Market Mechanics**:
- Multiple nations can participate in the same market
- Locations trade exclusively with their assigned market
- Market assignment based on two competing forces:
  - **Market Attraction**: Pull toward closest/most developed market
  - **Market Protection**: Policies to keep markets within your control

### Market vs. EU4 Trade Nodes

**Key Differences**:
- Markets are **dynamic** and can shift boundaries
- Based on **distance, infrastructure, and population**
- Interconnected across regions, not fixed paths
- Every pop participates in market economy
- Markets respond to player development choices

**Strategic Implications**:
- Develop Market Centers to attract more locations
- Build infrastructure (roads, marketplaces) to expand influence
- Compete with neighbors for market control
- Control over markets = control over trade revenue

### Market Integration

Markets are deeply integrated with:
- **Population System**: Each pop buys and sells in markets
- **Buildings**: Marketplaces increase market capacity
- **Trade Routes**: Connect distant markets
- **Geopolitics**: Market control influences power projection

## Claims & Casus Belli System

EU5 has **eliminated the traditional claims system**, replacing it entirely with Casus Belli (CBs).

### Casus Belli Overview

**Definition**: Legal justification for declaring war and seizing territory.

**Major Change from EU4**:
- No more fabricating claims through diplomats
- No permanent claims on map
- All expansion requires specific CBs
- CBs are temporary and expire

### Three Methods to Obtain Casus Belli

#### 1. Parliament Motions

**Process**:
- Every 5 years, call Parliament
- Propose a motion for war against specific nation
- Requires support from over 50% of Parliament
- Success depends on estate satisfaction

**Parliament Voting**:
- Each estate votes based on their interests
- High satisfaction estates more likely to support
- Strategic estates may oppose certain wars
- Requires political management

**Result**:
- Temporary CB granted if motion passes
- Specific to the nation targeted
- Expires if not used within time limit

#### 2. Spy Networks

**Requirements**:
- Build Spy Network to 20 progress
- Costs espionage resources
- Takes time to establish

**Process**:
1. Click on target nation
2. Select "Build Spy Network" under Covert Actions
3. Wait for 20 progress
4. Unlock CB options

**Available CBs at 20 Spy Network**:
- **Conquest**: General territorial expansion
- **Humiliation**: Reduce target's prestige and power
- **Religious War**: Convert or seize land from different religion
- **Reconquest**: Only available for land you previously owned (requires cores)

**Cost**: 20 Spy Network progress

#### 3. Events and Situations

**Dynamic CBs**:
- Granted through historical events
- Tied to major storylines and missions
- Example: "Rise of the Turks" situation grants specific CBs
- Often tied to specific regions or rivals

**Advantages**:
- Free CBs without player effort
- Often powerful and wide-ranging
- Tied to historical opportunities
- May grant multiple CBs simultaneously

### Casus Belli Mechanics

**Expiration**:
- Most CBs expire after **4 years**
- Use or lose your justification
- Plan wars around CB availability
- Some event CBs may have different timers

**Declaring War Without CB**:
- Always possible but heavily penalized
- Costs **+50 Stability**
- Grants **+1 War Exhaustion**
- Additional **20 Righteousness or Karma** (if religion uses resource)
- Generally not recommended except in emergencies

### CB Strategy

**Early Game**:
- Rely on Parliament motions
- Keep estates satisfied for CB approval
- Use event CBs when available
- Avoid war without CB (stability too valuable)

**Mid Game**:
- Build spy networks for targeted expansion
- Chain CBs to maintain continuous expansion
- Use reconquest CBs for former territory
- Balance CB acquisition with war timing

**Late Game**:
- Multiple spy networks simultaneously
- Leverage situations for free CBs
- Plan expansion routes around CB availability
- Use Parliament for controversial wars

## Cores & Control System

### Core Provinces

**Definition**: Provinces that your nation has historical/legal claim to.

**Core Mechanics**:
- Former territories you once controlled
- Can be reconquered with special CB
- Reconquest CB only available through Spy Network
- Reduces antagonism compared to conquest

**Reconquest Benefits**:
- Lower antagonism generation
- Faster integration
- Less coalition risk
- Cheaper in terms of diplomatic penalties

### Control System

**Control represents authority over a province**:
- Higher control = more manpower contribution
- Increases recruitment efficiency
- Improves tax collection
- Reduces unrest

**Increasing Control**:
- Time in peaceful province
- Administrative buildings
- Government policies
- Stationed armies (temporary boost)

**Control Loss**:
- Enemy occupation during war
- Rebellions and unrest
- Recent conquest
- Low stability

## Colonial Mechanics

EU5 features a completely redesigned colonization system emphasizing population migration and power projection.

### Colonial Charters

**Definition**: Colonial charters send your own population to a province to establish a colony.

**How Charters Work**:
1. Select target province within colonial range
2. Initiate colony charter
3. Pops migrate from your nation to colony
4. Colony grows as more pops arrive
5. At 1,000 population, colony becomes self-sustaining

**Colonial Range**:
- Each country has limited colonial range
- Based on naval technology
- Extended by:
  - Naval bases
  - Exploration advances
  - Maritime ideas
  - Trade offices in distant regions

### Colony Growth

**Population Migration**:
- Colonies grow **only through migration** of existing pops
- Natural growth once established
- Requires pops willing to migrate

**Support Colonial Charter Action**:
- Manually move pops to colonies
- Speeds up colonization
- Costs government power
- Useful for strategic colonies

**Self-Sustaining Threshold**:
- **1,000 population** required
- Colony joins your trade network
- Begins contributing to economy
- Can build buildings and develop

### Colonial Competition

**Simultaneous Colonization**:
- Multiple countries can colonize same province
- First to complete process wins the province
- Loser suffers penalties

**Loser Penalties**:
- Lose **Prestige**, **Gold**, or **Government Power**
- Penalty is whichever resource is highest
- Significant setback to colonial efforts

**Strategic Implications**:
- Race to colonize valuable provinces
- Use Support Colonial Charter to win races
- Avoid competing with stronger colonial powers
- Target uncontested regions when possible

### Power Projection & Colonization

**Colonial Buildings in Foreign Territory**:
- Build trade offices in locations owned by weaker nations
- Establish colonies in their territory
- Create slave centers (historical context)
- Build missions and other specific structures

**Power Projection Advantage**:
- Greater power projection difference = faster colonial charter takeover
- Can take control of locations from weaker nations
- Each point of power projection reduces colonization requirements by **0.5%**
- Reduces percentage of primary religion/culture pops needed

**Colonization Completion Requirements**:
- Normally requires majority pops of primary religion and culture
- Power projection reduces this percentage
- 100 power projection advantage = 50% reduction in requirements
- Enables easier colonization of diverse regions

### Colonial Strategy

**Early Colonization**:
- Establish colonial range through naval bases
- Target uncontested regions
- Avoid competition with major powers
- Focus on trade-rich provinces

**Mid-Game Expansion**:
- Use power projection to compete
- Support colonial charters in valuable regions
- Establish trade networks
- Build colonial infrastructure

**Late-Game Dominance**:
- Leverage power projection to take over weaker colonies
- Establish global trade empire
- Use colonies for resources and trade
- Maintain colonial control through naval superiority

## Power Projection

**Power Projection** represents your nation's ability to exert influence beyond your borders.

### Power Projection Effects

**Colonial Advantages**:
- Build special buildings in weaker nations' territory
- Faster colonial charter takeover
- Reduced colonization requirements (-0.5% per point)
- Competitive advantage in colonial races

**Diplomatic Influence**:
- Greater bargaining power
- Easier to enforce demands
- Intimidation factor in negotiations
- Ability to pressure weaker nations

### Increasing Power Projection

**Methods** (not fully documented, likely includes):
- Large navy relative to rivals
- Colonial presence
- Controlling strategic trade routes
- Defeating rivals in wars
- High prestige and great power status
- Military technology advantage

## Great Power System

The **9 countries with highest Great Power Score** become Great Powers.

### Great Power Score Calculation

**Great Power Score Components**:
- **Population**: Larger population increases score
- **Income**: Economic strength matters
- **Advances**: Technological and ideological progress
- **Stability**: Political cohesion
- **Prestige**: International reputation
- **Government Power**: Administrative capacity
- **Markets**: Economic control
- **Trade Routes**: Commercial reach
- **Navy**: Naval strength
- **Allies**: Diplomatic connections
- **Army**: Military power
- **Discipline**: Army quality
- **War Exhaustion**: Penalties for ongoing conflicts (negative factor)

**Balanced Calculation**: Great Power Score rewards well-rounded nations, not just military strength.

### Great Power Benefits

**Special Diplomatic Actions**:
- **Intervene in Wars**: Join ongoing conflicts without being called
- **Enforce Peace**: Force warring nations to negotiate
- **Threaten War**: Coerce smaller nations without fighting
- **Additional Benefits**: Prestige bonuses, diplomatic advantages

**Great Power Privileges**:
- More influence in international organizations
- Greater diplomatic capacity
- Enhanced power projection
- Access to exclusive policies

### Subject Integration

**Subjects Transfer Great Power Score**:
- Percentage transferred depends on subject type
- Vassals transfer significant portion
- Colonial subjects transfer less
- Personal unions transfer moderate amounts

**Subject Restriction**:
- Subjects **cannot become Great Powers**
- Their score contributes to overlord
- Prevents vassals from competing with overlord
- Encourages integration of strong subjects

### Great Power Strategy

**Becoming a Great Power**:
- Balance all components (not just military)
- Develop economy and population
- Maintain stability and prestige
- Build allies and trade networks
- Invest in navy and army quality

**Maintaining Great Power Status**:
- Avoid high war exhaustion
- Continue technological advancement
- Expand markets and trade
- Keep population growing
- Maintain strong military

**Using Great Power Actions**:
- Intervene to support allies
- Enforce peace to prevent coalitions
- Threaten rivals without war costs
- Leverage status for diplomatic gains

## Strategic Considerations

### Market Control

**Economic Dominance**:
- Control key Market Centers
- Build infrastructure to expand market influence
- Compete for market control with neighbors
- Markets = trade income = economic power

**Market Competition**:
- Defend your markets from foreign influence
- Use Market Protection policies strategically
- Attract locations through development
- Build Marketplaces in key locations

### Expansion Planning

**CB Acquisition Timeline**:
- Plan wars around CB availability
- Chain CBs for continuous expansion
- Use Parliament every 5 years
- Build spy networks in advance
- Leverage event CBs immediately

**Expansion Pacing**:
- Balance expansion with antagonism
- Use reconquest CBs when available
- Avoid unjustified wars (stability cost)
- Time wars around CB expiration

### Colonial Empire Building

**Prioritize**:
1. Establish colonial range
2. Target high-value trade regions
3. Build power projection advantage
4. Support colonial charters in races
5. Develop self-sustaining colonies

**Avoid**:
- Competing with stronger colonial powers early
- Over-extending colonial range
- Neglecting colony development
- Abandoning colonies before 1,000 population

### Great Power Competition

**Climbing the Ranks**:
- Focus on weakest score components
- Balance military and economic power
- Maintain high stability
- Reduce war exhaustion quickly
- Build diverse power base

**Maintaining Position**:
- Monitor rivals' Great Power Score
- Prevent competitors from catching up
- Use Great Power actions strategically
- Leverage subject Great Power Score transfer

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Ignoring Market Competition**: Losing market control to neighbors reduces trade income
2. **Declaring War Without CB**: Massive stability penalty not worth it in most cases
3. **Letting CBs Expire**: Waste of effort building spy networks or passing Parliament motions
4. **Colonial Over-Extension**: Colonies too far from range or too many simultaneous charters
5. **Neglecting Power Projection**: Losing colonial competition to higher power projection nations
6. **Unbalanced Great Power Score**: Focusing only on military while neglecting economy/population
7. **Subject Mismanagement**: Not leveraging subject Great Power Score contribution
8. **Market Over-Protection**: Isolating your markets reduces trade opportunities
