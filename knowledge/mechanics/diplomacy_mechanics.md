# EU5 Diplomacy Mechanics

This document provides a comprehensive overview of diplomatic systems in Europa Universalis 5.

## Core Diplomacy Concepts

### Diplomatic Capacity

**Diplomatic capacity dictates how many relations a country can have with another country.**

**Capacity Costs Determined By**:
- Population difference between countries
- Rank difference (Great Power vs. Minor Nation)
- Opinion between countries
- Trust level (reduces costs)

**Strategic Implication**: Build trust to reduce capacity costs and maintain more relationships.

### Diplomatic Reputation

**Diplomatic Reputation reflects how other nations view your reliability.**

**Benefits of High Reputation**:
- Easier to form alliances
- Better vassalization opportunities
- More favorable peace agreements
- Improved trust building

**Reputation Increases From**:
- Government reforms
- Laws and policies
- Technological advances
- Reliable diplomatic behavior
- Honoring commitments

**Reputation Decreases From**:
- Breaking alliances
- Violating truces
- Dishonoring commitments
- Aggressive actions

## The Favor System

The favor system forms the backbone of EU5's diplomatic interactions, replacing simpler relationship modifiers from previous games.

### Earning Favors

**Favors Accumulate Through**:
- Sending gifts
- Providing military support
- Honoring alliance calls
- Economic assistance
- Diplomatic backing

### Using Favors

Favors become your **diplomatic currency** for:
- Requesting military support
- Calling allies into wars
- Asking for diplomatic favors
- Requesting territorial concessions
- Influencing policies

### Favor Transfers

**Favors can transfer between nations**:
- If France sends you financial aid, favors transfer back to France
- Creates diplomatic debt
- Influences future relationships
- Can create chains of obligations

**Strategic Use**: Build favors with key allies before major wars.

## Relations & Trust

### Opinion

**Opinion** represents how one country views another on a -200 to +200 scale.

**High Opinion** (Positive):
- Easier diplomatic actions
- Alliance formation possible
- Trade agreements favorable
- Military access granted

**Low Opinion** (Negative):
- Difficult diplomacy
- Potential rivalry
- Hostile actions likely
- Coalition risk

### Trust

**Trust** is a shared measure between two countries showing **how much they believe in your promises**.

**Trust Growth**:
- Honoring alliance calls
- Keeping agreements
- Long-term friendly relations
- Shared diplomatic goals

**Trust Benefits**:
- Reduced diplomatic capacity costs
- Stronger alliances
- Better cooperation
- More favorable agreements

**Trust Penalties**:
- Breaking alliances
- Violating agreements
- Dishonoring commitments

## Rivalries

**Countries can declare their hostility towards other countries by declaring them as rivals.**

### Rivalry Requirements

- Countries must have **similar Great Power Score**
- Must have **negative opinion** of target
- Cannot rival allies or subjects

### Rivalry Benefits

**Additional Hostile Actions**:
- Fabricate Casus Belli against rivals
- Intervene in rival's wars
- Support rival's enemies
- Embargo rival trade

**Shared Rivalry Bonus**:
- **If two countries have the same rival, they gain +50 Opinion** with each other
- Facilitates alliance formation
- Creates natural diplomatic blocs
- "The enemy of my enemy is my friend"

### Rivalry Strategy

**When to Rival**:
- Natural competitors for territory
- Blocking your expansion
- Threatening your interests
- Potential future conflicts

**Rivalry Risks**:
- Can trigger coalition formation
- Complicates diplomacy
- Locks in hostile relationship
- Difficult to reverse

## Coalitions & Antagonism

### The Antagonism System

**Antagonism replaces EU4's "Aggressive Expansion"** with more nuanced geopolitical concern.

**Key Antagonism Factors**:

1. **Proximity**: Neighbors care most about your actions
2. **Culture & Faith**: Shared identities intensify reactions
3. **Strategic Interests**: Overlapping claims or trade routes increase antagonism
4. **Alliances**: Friends of your victims turn hostile

**Antagonism is NOT a flat penalty**—it reflects real geopolitical concerns.

### Coalition Formation

**Coalition Trigger**: If a country has more than **50 Antagonism**, coalitions can form against it.

**Coalition Mechanics**:
- No longer automatic "join if AE > 50"
- Form based on **strategic proximity** and **mutual interests**
- Operate with realistic constraints
- Nations won't join if they have their own conflicts
- Geographic and political limitations apply

**Coalition Behavior**:
- Defensive alliance against aggressive nation
- Can declare war collectively
- Deterrent to rapid expansion
- Dissolves if antagonism decreases

### Managing Antagonism

**Reduce Antagonism By**:
- Time passage (natural decay)
- Improving relations
- Return conquered cores
- Diplomatic actions
- Avoiding further aggression

**Avoid Excessive Antagonism**:
- Pace your expansion
- Target nations without many allies
- Use valid casus belli
- Return provinces to reduce antagonism
- Build truces between conquests

## Alliances

### Alliance Formation

**Requirements**:
- Positive opinion (typically +50 or higher)
- Diplomatic capacity available
- No conflicting alliances
- Mutual strategic benefit

**Alliance Benefits**:
- Defensive military support
- Call allies into offensive wars (costs favors)
- Shared rivalry bonuses
- Diplomatic backing

### Alliance Management

**Maintaining Alliances**:
- Honor alliance calls (builds trust)
- Provide military support when able
- Avoid actions that harm ally's interests
- Build favors for future needs

**Breaking Alliances**:
- Severe reputation penalty
- Loss of trust with all nations
- Makes future alliances difficult
- Should be last resort

## International Organizations

**International Organizations represent EU5's most innovative diplomatic feature.**

### Organization Types

**Holy Roman Empire**:
- Complex internal diplomacy
- Emperor and princes
- Imperial authority system
- Reforms and elections

**Personal Unions**:
- Dynasty-based diplomatic ties
- Junior partner under senior partner
- Share wars and diplomacy
- Can integrate over time

**Colonial Empires**:
- Mother country and colonies
- Trade and economic ties
- Graduated independence

**Other Organizations**:
- Regional alliances
- Trade leagues
- Military coalitions

### Organization Benefits

- Collective security
- Economic cooperation
- Political influence
- Military coordination

## Diplomatic Actions

### Common Actions

**Alliance Proposals**: Form defensive pact
**Royal Marriage**: Dynastic ties (monarchies only)
**Military Access**: Allow troop passage
**Trade Agreement**: Economic cooperation
**Guarantee Independence**: Protect smaller nations
**Vassalization**: Make country your subject

### Hostile Actions
