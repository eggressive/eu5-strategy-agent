# EU5 Warfare Mechanics

This document outlines the core concepts of warfare in Europa Universalis 5, based on information from the official Paradox Wiki. [1]

## Declaring War

When a country declares war, a comparison of the military strength of both sides is presented. The initiator of the war and the primary target are designated as **War Leaders**. Allies can be called into the war, but only the War Leaders have the authority to negotiate and accept peace treaties. A country cannot declare war on another nation if they are already allies in an ongoing conflict.

Each participant in a war has a **War Participation** score, which reflects their contribution to the war effort. This score influences the post-war opinions of allies regarding the peace treaty.

## Types of Wars

There are two main types of wars in EU5:

- **Civil Wars:** These erupt when a rebellion reaches 100% progress. They are total wars that only end with the complete annexation of one side. Civil wars do not use casus belli, treaties, or warscore.
- **Country Wars:** These are conventional wars declared by one country on another. They utilize casus belli, peace treaties, and warscore to determine the outcome.

### Casus Belli and Wargoals

A **Casus Belli** (CB) is the justification for declaring war. Each CB provides a specific **Wargoal**, which is the primary objective of the war. Achieving the wargoal grants a significant amount of warscore. Declaring war without a valid CB incurs significant stability and war exhaustion penalties.

### Peace Treaties and Warscore

Wars are concluded through **Peace Treaties**. The side with a positive **Warscore** can enforce demands on the losing side. Warscore is gained by winning battles, occupying provinces, achieving the wargoal, and blockading enemy ports. A warscore of at least 10 is required to make demands in a peace treaty.

The cost of peace treaty terms is influenced by the scope of the demands. A country's willingness to accept a peace offer depends on the warscore difference, their war exhaustion, and the duration of the war.

## War Exhaustion

**War Exhaustion** represents the toll that a prolonged war takes on a country. High war exhaustion leads to significant penalties, including reduced military morale, production and trade efficiency, and population growth. If war exhaustion becomes too high, a country may be forced to accept an unfavorable peace treaty. War exhaustion naturally decreases during peacetime.

## Declaring War Costs

Declaring war comes with several potential costs, especially if done without proper justification or against a friendly nation. These costs can include stability loss, increased war exhaustion, and antagonism.

## Blockades

A **Blockade** is established when a hostile navy is present in a sea zone adjacent to an enemy port. The effectiveness of a blockade depends on the size of the blockading fleet and the economic activity of the port. Successful blockades can have a devastating impact on a nation's economy and war effort by reducing food production, trade, and control.
